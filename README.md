In today’s world, we should be able to track of all procurements concluded
by the state and see how public money is being spent. And there’s public
contract registry to monitor how the state spends taxpayers money.
A public contract registry is an online repository that aims at keeping track
of all procurements concluded by the state and making this information available online, thereby providing a basis for monitoring the way in which public
money is spent. Establishing contract registries can be a powerful tool to
highlight the way in which taxpayers’ money is used.
There are public contract registries in the Czech Republic and one of the
is Hl´ıdaˇc st´atu: https://www.hlidacstatu.cz/. Hlídač Státu is a non-profit
organization whose goal is to make the state administration completely transparent. The Hl´ıdaˇc st´atu is a web platform where they check, analyze and link
contracts from the register of contracts, public contracts, subsidies, sponsors
of political parties and politics in one place.

The primary objective of this thesis is to design, implement and test a website
that will present the winners of public contracts in the Czech Republic. The
main widget should be a map with regions and based on the zoom level other
dashboards will be updated. The software project relies on data sets provided
by Hl´ıdaˇc st´atu API. The solutions provided by this thesis work will show the
total amount of contracts, shares across the companies and if you choose one
company then to show specific dashboard with a share in regions and in the
area of similar contracts.


The thesis work has the following chapters, which are Analysis, Design, Implementation and Conclusion.
In the analysis chapter the requirements, domain of the application and the
analysis of existing solutions are described. The requirements for the implementation are defined and discussed in the requirements part of the analysis.
The application’s domain model is defined and discussed in domain part of
the analysis. In the section of analysis of existing solutions the application
is analyzed and compared to similar applications that exist on the market
already.
The design chapter describes the solutions needed to accomplish the goal of
this project, which are the technologies to be used, the architecture of this
software application, database model, class model and sequence model. In
the first section of the design chapter there are technologies described that
are used for the application’s implementation. In the following section of architecture, the application’s architecture and structure is discussed. In the
database section the application’s database model is discussed. The class
model section describes the application’s sequence model. In the section of
sequence model the application’s sequence models are presented and discussed.
The implementation chapter contains discussion of the tools used during the
development process, implementation details and tests. The tools section
contains described tools used for the application’s implementation are defined
and discussed. The implementation details section includes nontrivial implementations tackled during the application’s implementation process. In the
testing section, the tests used in he application’s implementation are discussed.
The conclusion chapter contains the summary of the thesis.
